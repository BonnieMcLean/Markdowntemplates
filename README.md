# Markdown templates

Templates for writing articles in R markdown, exporting to word or pdf (for static documents) and html (for interactive documents).

I have included a separate template for each output type, but you don't need to do this. You can change between output types for the same document by changing the material in the yaml header (see how it is setup in each template).
