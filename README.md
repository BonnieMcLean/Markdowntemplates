# Markdown templates

Templates for writing articles in R markdown, exporting to word or pdf (for static documents) and html (for interactive documents).

I have included a separate template for each output type, but really you only need one document and then you can go between different output types by changing the material in the yaml header. The content of the markdown documents apart from the header is the same across all output types.
