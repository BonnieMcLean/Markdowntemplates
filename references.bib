However, as previous studies have either been lacking in scope or in phonetic granularity, the present study investigates the phonetic and semantic features involved from a bottom-up perspective. By analyzing the phonemes of 344 near-universal concepts in 245 language families, we establish 125 sound-meaning associations. The results also show that between 19 and 40 of the items of the Swadesh-100 list are sound symbolic, which calls into question the list’s ability to determine genetic relationships. In addition, by combining co-occurring semantic and phonetic features between the sound symbolic concepts, 20 {\textless}em{\textgreater}macro-concepts{\textless}/em{\textgreater} can be identified, e. g. basic descriptors, deictic distinctions and kinship attributes. Furthermore, all identified macro-concepts can be grounded in four types of sound symbolism: (a) unimodal imitation ({\textless}em{\textgreater}onomatopoeia{\textless}/em{\textgreater}); (b) cross-modal imitation ({\textless}em{\textgreater}vocal gestures{\textless}/em{\textgreater}); (c) diagrammatic mappings based on relation ({\textless}em{\textgreater}relative{\textless}/em{\textgreater}); or (d) situational mappings ({\textless}em{\textgreater}circumstantial{\textless}/em{\textgreater}). These findings show that sound symbolism is rooted in the human perception of the body and its interaction with the surrounding world, and could therefore have originated as a bootstrapping mechanism, which can help us understand the bio-cultural origins of human language, the mental lexicon and language diversity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},
